  DESCRIPTION:
    "We've booked out Lighthaven for a single day, Dec 14. We'll have unconference-style sessions, a smattering of events like charity poker, and ample time to hang out and chat. We're running this on a shoestring budget, so that everyone can come -- eg expect a homecooked dinner instead of catering. It'll be a cozy, lowkey, experimental version of the Manifest you know and love.",
